# Supermart-Sales-Analysis
[Tableau dashboard for analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hannah.pham.analysis/viz/SupermartGrocerySales_16739374564640/Dashboard1)

## About the project
With the signigicant increase of inflation, groceries's prices have also been rising quickly. I decided to pick a grocery store to analyze their sales in 4 years. 

## About the dataset
The dataset is not based on actual sales of Supermart, but is used only for the purpose for analysis. 
The dataset provides information about online orders with order id, category, sub category, order date, region, sales amount, discount amount, profits and states. 

## Questions for the analysis
1. What is the sales trend in 4 years (2015-2018)?
2. Which category has the highest sales? Which category has the highest profits?
3. What is the average profit margins?
4. What region has the highest sales?
5. What steps should marketing department take in the future to increase sales?
